# Java Journal Codes

## Welcome to my Java programming journal repository!

This repository contains my personal collection of Java programs covering a wide range of topics, including number manipulation, array sorting, class and object concepts, function overloading, interface implementation, and more.

Each program is designed to showcase different Java programming concepts and techniques. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it an excellent resource for beginners and advanced Java developers alike.

Feel free to browse through the repository and explore the programs. You can use them as a learning resource, inspiration for your own projects, or simply to brush up on your Java skills.

If you find any issues or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

Thank you for visiting my Java programming journal repository. Happy coding!

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you need to clone it on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:



    git clone https://github.com/anonatul/Java-Journal.git


This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

## Prerequisites

To run the Java programs in this repository, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of JDK from the official Java website.

## Installing

Once you have cloned the repository and installed JDK, you can import the programs into your Java development environment (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.) and run them from there.

## Running the Programs

To run a program, you need to compile the Java file first. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    javac ProgramName.java

This will compile the Java file and generate a class file. To run the program, you need to run the following command:

    java ProgramName

Replace ProgramName with the name of the Java file (without the .java extension).
